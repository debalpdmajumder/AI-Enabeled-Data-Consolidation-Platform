### Enhanced Prompt: Extract GL Data from Excel File

I have an Excel file named **"InterCompany.xlsx"** containing intercompany transactions. I want to extract all rows that contain:

- **GL Code** (8-digit numeric values)
- **GL Description**
- **Dr**
- **Cr**
- **Net**

These columns may appear multiple times and may not be aligned consistently. Please:

1. Load the file **"InterCompany.xlsx"** and scan all sheets.
2. Search each row for cells that resemble a **GL Code** (8-digit numeric).
3. When a GL Code is found, dynamically search within a window of **Â±10 columns** around the GL Code cell to locate:
   - GL Description (preferably a nearby string value)
   - Dr (first numeric value found after GL Code)
   - Cr (next numeric value after Dr)
   - Net (next numeric value after Cr)
4. Use robust error handling to skip rows with missing or invalid data.
5. Compile all extracted rows into a structured dataset with columns:
   - GL Code
   - GL Description
   - Dr
   - Cr
   - Net
6. Export the result to a new Excel file named **"InterCompanyExtract.xlsx"**.

The goal is to **maximize the number of valid GL entries** extracted, even if the layout is inconsistent.
