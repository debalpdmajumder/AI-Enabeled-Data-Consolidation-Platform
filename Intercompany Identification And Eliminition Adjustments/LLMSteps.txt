✅ Step-by-Step Process
Step 1: Understand the Intercompany File
The file contains intercompany balances between related entities, including:

GL Codes and Descriptions
Dr/Cr amounts for each entity
Net balances
Entries to be taken (i.e., which GL accounts to adjust)
Entity names and currencies
Remarks or explanations

These entries are meant to eliminate intercompany transactions that should not appear in consolidated financial statements.

Step 2: Identify Relevant Entries

Focus on rows where:

There are non-zero net balances between entities.
Entries are marked as “Entry to be taken” or have GL codes and Dr/Cr values.
Ignore rows with “No Entry to be taken” or where differences are due to Exchange Differences (ED) unless specified otherwise.




Step 3: Aggregate Adjustments

For each GL Code, calculate the net adjustment:

Sum all Dr and Cr values.
Compute net effect (Dr − Cr).




Step 4: Match with Trial Balance

Match the GL Codes from the intercompany file with the "G/L Acct/BP Code" in the trial balance.
For each matched GL Code:

Add the net adjustment to the existing balance.




Step 5: Update Trial Balance

Add the following columns:

Intercompany Adjustment: Net adjustment from intercompany file
Adjusted Balance
Description: Explanation like:
"Original Balance: X, Intercompany Adjustment: Y, Adjusted Balance: Z. Reason: Intercompany elimination for [Entity/Transaction]"




Step 6: Save the Updated File

Create a new Excel file with:

Original Trial Balance
Adjusted Trial Balance with new columns
