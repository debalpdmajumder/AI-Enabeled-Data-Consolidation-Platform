✅ Step-by-Step Application Process
Step 1: Understand the Adjustment File
The cleaned file contains:

Debit GL Code
Credit GL Code
Debit Amount
Credit Amount
Remarks

Each row represents a journal entry with a debit and credit side, and the goal is to reflect these adjustments in the trial balance.

Step 2: Normalize and Aggregate Adjustments

Convert all GL codes to string format for consistent matching.
For each GL code:

Sum all debit amounts where it appears as a Debit GL Code.
Sum all credit amounts where it appears as a Credit GL Code.
Compute the net adjustment as:
Net = Total Debit − Total Credit




Step 3: Match with Trial Balance

Match each GL code from the adjustment file with the "G/L Acct/BP Code" in the trial balance.
For each matched GL code:

Add the net adjustment to the existing balance in the trial balance.




Step 4: Update Trial Balance

Add the following columns:

Audit Adjustment: Net adjustment amount
Adjusted Balance: Original balance + adjustment
Description:
"Original Balance: X, Audit Adjustment: Y, Adjusted Balance: Z. Reason: [Remarks]"




Step 5: Save the Updated File

Create a new Excel file with:

Original Trial Balance
Adjusted Trial Balance with the new columns
