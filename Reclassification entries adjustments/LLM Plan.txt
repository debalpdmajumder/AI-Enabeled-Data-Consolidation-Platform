âœ… Step-by-Step Process
Step 1: Understand the Reclassification File
The file contains:

GL Codes and Descriptions
Amounts for different years (e.g., June'25, 2025, 2024, etc.)
Some GL codes appear in pairs (e.g., one positive, one negative), indicating a reclassification from one account to another.

These entries are not new transactions but reallocations of balances between accounts to better reflect their nature or classification.

Step 2: Focus on the Relevant Period

Use the "June'25" column for adjustments, as it aligns with the reporting period of the trial balance.
Filter out rows where the June'25 value is zero or missing.


Step 3: Identify Reclassification Pairs

Group entries by S.No. or by matching positive and negative values in the same amount.
For each pair:

One GL code will have a debit (positive) amount.
The other will have a credit (negative) amount.
These should net to zero.




Step 4: Apply Adjustments

For each GL code:

Add the June'25 amount to the existing balance in the trial balance.
This will reclassify the amount from one account to another.




Step 5: Update Trial Balance

Add new columns:

Reclassification Adjustment (June'25)
Adjusted Balance
Description:
"Original Balance: X, Reclassification Adjustment: Y, Adjusted Balance: Z. Reason: Reclassified from/to [other GL Code]"




Step 6: Save the Updated File

Create a new Excel file with:

Original Trial Balance
Adjusted Trial Balance with the new columns
