## Processing Steps

### Step 1: Data Validation

**Actions:**
- Open both files and verify GL Code columns exist
- Check GL Code format consistency across files
- Confirm Adjustment file has Debit and Credit columns

**Report:**
- Total GL Codes in Unadjusted Trial Balance
- Total adjustment entries
- Any format inconsistencies

---

### Step 2: Match GL Codes

**Actions:**
- Create master list of unique GL Codes from Unadjusted Trial Balance
- Match GL Codes from Adjustment file
- Flag unmatched GL Codes

**Report:**

### Step 3: Filter Non-Zero Adjustments

**Actions:**

- Exclude zero/blank entries
- Keep GL Code, Name, Debit, Credit, and reference columns

**Report:**
- Total entries before/after filtering
- Sample of 3-5 filtered entries

---

### Step 4: Apply Adjustments

```
Adjusted Balance = Original Balance + Total Debits - Total Credits
```

**Process:**
1. Start with original balance
2. Sum all Debit adjustments per GL Code
3. Sum all Credit adjustments per GL Code
4. Calculate adjusted balance
5. Round to 2 decimal places

**Report for each GL Code:**

- Example: "Adjusted_Trial_Balance_RECA_20241015_143052.xlsx"
- Format: Year(4 digits) Month(2) Day(2) underscore Hour(2) Minute(2) Second(2)

**Actions:**
- Generate a complete Excel workbook (.xlsx format)
- Save with datetime-stamped filename
- Provide a download link for the file
- DO NOT just display data in chat - create an actual downloadable file

**Main Worksheet Columns:**
1. GL Code
2. Account Name
3. Balance Before Adjustment (MYR)
4. [Adjustment Type] - Debit
5. [Adjustment Type] - Credit
6. Net Adjustment

- Total GL Codes adjusted
- Net adjustment amount
- Unmatched GL Codes list

**Final Step:**
- Create the Excel file with datetime in filename
- Make it available for download
- Provide clear instructions on how to download the file
- Confirm file creation with: "✓ Excel file created: [filename] - ready for download"

---

## Validation Checks

**Check 1:** Total Debits = Total Credits (before and after)
**Check 2:** Sum of adjustments matches source file
**Check 3:** All original GL Codes present, no duplicates
**Check 4:** Proper formatting, no blank critical cells

**Provide validation report with:**
- ✓ Pass or ✗ Fail for each check
- Explanations of failures
- Corrective actions

---

## Error Handling

**Missing GL Codes:** List them and ask to skip, create new rows, or abort

**Format Inconsistencies:** Show examples and suggest standardization

**Missing Columns:** List expected vs. found, request guidance

**Imbalanced Adjustments:** Report imbalance amount and ask to proceed or abort

---

## Reusability

Change inputs for different scenarios:
- Different source files (same structure)
- Different adjustment types (Audit, Reclassification, Accrual, Intercompany, FX, Tax)
- Different output names with period/type

**Best Practices:**
- Maintain consistent GL Code format
- Use standard column names
- Archive source files with dates
- Include version numbers in output names

**MUST PROVIDE A DOWNLOADABLE FILE:**

1. **Excel File Output:**
   - Create actual .xlsx file with datetime stamp
   - Filename format: "Adjusted_Trial_Balance_RECA_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.xlsx"
