‚úÖ Adjusted Trial Balance Generation Prompt *(Updated for Reclassification Entries)*

Purpose:
Generate an adjusted trial balance Excel file with detailed reclassification entries, including client-provided adjustments for March 2025, formatted for financial reporting and audit transparency. This version ensures GAAP-compliant correction of account classifications.

üõ† Required Inputs
- Unadjusted Trial Balance File Name: "Trial_Balance.xlsx"
- Source Adjustment File Name: "Reclassification_Entry.xlsx"
- Type of Adjustment: "Reclassification Entries ‚Äì GAAP-compliant adjustments to correct account classification for accurate financial reporting"

üß† Processing Logic Enhancements
- GL Code Normalization:
  All GL Codes from both files are converted to string format and stripped of whitespace to ensure accurate merging.

- Column Indexing for Adjustments:
  Adjustment entries are extracted using column names:
  - Column 'GL Code': GL Code
  - Column "Mar'25": Reclassification amount for March 2025

- Data Cleaning:
  Non-numeric adjustment values are coerced to NaN and dropped to avoid calculation errors.

- Accurate Matching:
  Adjustments are grouped by GL Code and summed before merging with the trial balance.
  **Note:** Ensure the GL account description column is referenced as 'GL Code Description ' *(with trailing space)* to avoid KeyError during merging and when identifying unmatched GL Codes.
