âœ… Step-by-Step Application Process
Step 1: Understand the Adjustment File
The file contains adjustments across multiple quarters, with the relevant one for roll forward being:

Apr'25 to Jun'25 (i.e., the current quarter being reported)

Each row includes:

GL Code: The account to adjust
Particulars: Description of the transaction (e.g., Dr. Interest expense)
Adjustment Amounts: For each quarter
PL/BS: Indicates if the account is part of the Profit & Loss or Balance Sheet
Remarks: Additional context


Step 2: Filter for Relevant Period

Focus only on the "Apr'25 to Jun'25" column.
Extract rows where the adjustment amount is non-zero.


Step 3: Aggregate Adjustments

Group the data by GL Code.
Sum the values in "Apr'25 to Jun'25" for each GL Code.
This gives the net adjustment per GL account.


Step 4: Match with Trial Balance

Match each GL Code from the adjustment file with the "G/L Acct/BP Code" in the trial balance.
For each matched GL Code:

Add the net adjustment to the existing balance in the trial balance.




Step 5: Update Trial Balance

Add the following columns:

Adjustment (Apr'25 to Jun'25): The net adjustment amount
Adjusted Balance: Original balance + adjustment
Description: A formulaic explanation like:
"Original Balance: X, Adjustment: Y, Adjusted Balance: Z. Reason: [Remarks for June'25]"




Step 6: Save the Updated File

Create a new Excel file with:

Original Trial Balance (for reference)
Adjusted Trial Balance with the new columns
